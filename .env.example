# IMPORTANT: Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key
# Never commit the .env file to version control

# 1. Keep this file permissions at 600 (read/write for owner only)
# 2. Never share your API key publicly
# 3. Regenerate your key if you suspect it's been compromised
# 4. Consider using a password manager to store API keys
